Basic idea 
Our project is a software based Insight System that provides real time disaster alerts for hilly and rural regions. By using live satellite data and weather information, the system identifies potential risks like heavy rainfall, floods, or cloudbursts and instantly displays alerts through an easy to understand interface.
In the future, this system can be extended with IoT enabled digital billboards in villages to ensure timely communication, even where phones or networks fail.
